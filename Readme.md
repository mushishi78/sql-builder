# SqlBuilder

This is a spike repository demonstrating a possible means of building
sql queries with static type checking with typescript.

Also, to be noted that I haven't compiled or run this code, so sorry
if I've made some basic stupid mistake.

## Usage

An example can be found in the "example" folder. `schema.ts` is
intended to be a generated file that maps column names to data
type and `example.ts` makes a simple select query and prints it
to the console.
